     Uncomment the following to compile the widgetset for one browser only.
     This can reduce the GWT compilation time significantly when debugging.
     The line should be commented out before deployment to production
     environments.
      
     Multiple browsers can be specified as a comma separated list. The 
     supported user agents at the moment of writing were:
     ie8,ie9,gecko1_8,safari,opera
     
     The value gecko1_8 is used for Firefox and safari is used for webkit
     based browsers including Google Chrome.

    <!--
     To enable SuperDevMode, uncomment this line.
     
     SuperDevMode enables debugging of the client side of a Vaadin
     application using the JavaScript debugger of a browser. Java code is
     shown and debugging can take place on the Java level when using a browser
     that support source maps (currently Chrome, implementation under work
     for Firefox).
     
     After uncommenting this property, run compile the widgetset once and run
     mvn jetty:run for the server-side. Then run mvn vaadin:run-codeserver and 
     add ?superdevmode to your application URL to activate SuperDevMode.
